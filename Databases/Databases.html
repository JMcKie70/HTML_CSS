              <h5>What are Databases?</h5>
              <div id="text1">
                  <h6>A structured set of data</h6>
                  <p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used
                    for creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are
                    many different types of databases and they can be classified
                    in a basic approach of relational database or a non-relational
                    database. Relationships means a set of our data is related
                    to another section of our data. Meanwhile in a non-relational
                    database there is not a common related section of our data.
                    Our databases are put into sections of data called shemas,
                    inside each schema each data set is organized into table,
                    those tbles contain columns and rows to house that particular
                    set of data.</p>

                  <p>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is
                    housed on your harddrive, often times large companies will
                    have floors upon floors of just database storage
                    (think NSA styled). Our computer stores information on the
                    harddrive, we are able to create new information, read
                    information, update information and delete information.</p>

                  <p>Since there could potentially be a lot of information a
                    database stores, onew problem we might run into is finding
                    the data we are looking for. Imagine we had a room full of
                    books and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm
                    Book. Well you might start picking up each book, checking
                    the title and moving onto the nezt until you found it.
                    That's very slow as most libraries discovered. Instead, if
                    we were ID each item we can find it quickly.</p>

                  <p>The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a
                    storage bin that holds onto all saved data. Well, if only
                    one user had access to that data it's just like what we
                    have built into our own compluters, it wouldn't be useful
                    to other users. However, the joy of having a database is
                    that it is a storage bin many users can interact with,
                    creating, reading, updating, and deleting information that
                    all users would see.</p>

                  <p>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the
                    storing of information. As Big Data has erupted, so too
                    have the size and amount of companies on the market. That
                    being said, a lot of their software is free for most users,
                    think of MySQL, which while being an incredible DB, is
                    completely free of cost and is used by a large company
                    called Facebook.</p>
